Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\raul.lora\documents\proyectotestraul\medusatesting\medusatesting\fpga1\src\i2c_control_startup.v":26:0:26:5|Found inferred clock cemf_module_64ch_main|scl which controls 94 sequential elements including I2C_top_level_inst1.I2C_Control_StartUp_inst.start_detect. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
